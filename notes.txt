Various notes; it is Rolf's decision if they should make it into readme.md or elsewhere.

Load into eclipse

A possibility is

(1) check out git as normal

(2) "New -> Java Project -> _uncheck_ the default location button and browse to the git directory

(3) There are two jxl libraries; they are in the wrong sequence and the sequence needs to be exchanged.
    (I think this has now been resolved and there is only one jxl library left.)
