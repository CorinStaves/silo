/**
 * The {@code RuntimeInterruptedException} is a wrapper for the checked exception {@code InterruptedException} and its
 * descendents. It is intended to be used to wrap the checked exception to allow it to be thrown without being declared.
 * This lower the programming burden (and perhaps annoyance) though it does raise the possiblity that some recoverable
 * exceptions may be allowed to percolate to runtime (and that they will not be indicated clearly in an ide environment).
 * Therefore, the use of this class should be clearly documented.
