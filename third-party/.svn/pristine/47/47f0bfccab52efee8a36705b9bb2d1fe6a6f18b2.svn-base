/**
 * The {@code IndexWrite} class provides a framework for writing indices.  In general, an index need not hold any connection
 * to a specific tensor (only to a dimension), so it is generally better to write an index sans any reference to a tensor.
 * Possible exceptions to this rule could be made when intricate reference tensor-index relationships are being preserved,
 * though in such cases this interface is probably not appropriate (in that it would be misleading). In general, most
 * {@code IndexWriter} implementations should have complementing implementations of {@code IndexReader}.
 *
 * @param <I> The type of the ids held by indices written by this writer.
