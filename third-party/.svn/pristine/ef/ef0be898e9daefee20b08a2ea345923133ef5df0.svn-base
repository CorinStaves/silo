** to set up a new repository, see "set up new repository" section at bottom of this document

repository_shell.zip is the folder structure that the repository should take
    core - the core sawdust programs
    integration - sawdust programs that connect sawdust with other (usually third-party) programs
    modeleing - sawdust programs that are more modeling specific than core
    projects - a folder holding the various project repositories
        within this folder there is a folder for each project, each holding its own repository
    third_party - a folder holding the third party software used by other programs
    repo - a folder holding various (meta) repository related files

repo_shell.jar contains a program for updating the repository directory and repository_shell.zip
    com.pb.sawdust.meta.RepoShell repository_dir pull
     - this updates the current repository directory stucture from repository_shell.zip 
       (this will not overwrite/replace/delete already existing directories)
    com.pb.sawdust.meta.RepoShell repository_dir push
     - this pushes the current directory structure into repository_shell.zip
    com.pb.sawdust.meta.RepoShell repository_dir pull push
     - this does both the push and pull operations; this is the command that should generally be
       used unless a repository directory is being setup for the first time

standard.zip is a standardized folder structure for a project or sub-project

ide_projects is a folder holding various ide project structures
    for Intellij IDEA projects, set a path variable (Settings -> Path Variables) named MAIN_REPOSITORY to 
    the location of your repository


***** set up new repository *****
install an Oracle java 7 jre
install git (and any other helper/integration programs, such as TortoiseGIT)
setup github account with ssh key and confirm ssh access to github

(1) create a new directory for the repository (it should be empty) - call this [repository_dir]
(2) create a subdirectory in [repository_dir] called "repo"
(3) into [repository_dir]/repo/ download the following files:
    - RepoShell.jar
    - repository_shell.zip
(4) run the following command (using Oracale java 7 jre)
    java -cp [repository_dir]/repo/repo_shell.jar com.pb.sawdust.meta.RepoShell [repository_dir] pull
(5) clone the repositories with a call like this:
    git clone git@github.com:frazierc/sawdust_integration.git .
