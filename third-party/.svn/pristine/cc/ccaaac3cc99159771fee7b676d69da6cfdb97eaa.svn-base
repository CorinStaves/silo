 * The {@code Transient} annotation is used to specify classes which might belong in a certain package, but need not be
 * included in distributions. Examples, tests, and experiments are all possible cases where this annotation might be applied.
 * Generally, the level of code quality, testing, and documentation will be much lower for a class with this annotation.
